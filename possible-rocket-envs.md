## Abstracting rocket environment with openai gymnasium

There are a few alternatives we could do to implement the openai-gymnasium compatible version of  `Rocket.py`.

### Wrapping
The wrapping approach involves creating a new class that wraps the existing Rocket class and implements the gymnasium interface.

Pros:
- Maintains complete separation between rocket physics and RL interface
- Original Rocket class remains unchanged and can be used independently
- Easy to modify the RL interface without touching core simulation
- Clear responsibility separation - wrapper handles RL, Rocket handles physics
- Can easily add preprocessing (like normalization) in the wrapper layer
- Easier to update if gymnasium API changes

Cons:
- Additional layer of indirection
- Slight performance overhead from delegation
- Need to manually map between wrapper and Rocket interfaces
- May need to expose more methods in Rocket class

### Subclassing
The subclassing approach would involve inheriting from both gym.Env and Rocket classes.

Pros:
- Direct access to all Rocket methods and attributes
- No need to duplicate code
- Can override only what needs to change
- Potentially less code than wrapping

Cons:
- Multiple inheritance can be complex
- Tight coupling between RL and physics code
- Changes to parent classes can break functionality
- Harder to maintain separation of concerns
- More difficult to modify independently

### Refactoring
The refactoring approach would involve rewriting the Rocket class to directly implement the gymnasium interface.

Pros:
- No indirection or delegation needed
- Potentially better performance
- Single unified class
- Direct implementation of gymnasium interface

Cons:
- Requires significant changes to existing code
- Mixes RL and physics concerns
- Less flexible for different use cases
- Harder to maintain backward compatibility
- More difficult to adapt to gymnasium API changes

### Final solution and reasoning

For the `rocket_env.py` implementation, we chose the **Wrapping** approach because:

1. **Maintainability**:
   - Clear separation between RL interface and rocket physics
   - Each class has a single responsibility
   - Easy to modify either part independently

2. **Simplicity**:
   - Clean interface between components
   - Straightforward to add normalization
   - No complex inheritance patterns
   - Easy to understand and modify

3. **Clarity**:
   - Clear distinction between RL and physics code
   - Explicit interface through well-defined methods
   - Easy to see what's happening at each layer

4. **Flexibility**:
   - Can use Rocket class independently
   - Easy to modify RL interface
   - Can add preprocessing steps cleanly
   - Simple to adapt to API changes

The implementation demonstrates these benefits through:
```python
class RocketEnv(gym.Env):
    def __init__(self, task='hover', rocket_type='falcon', render_mode=None):
        # Clean wrapper initialization
        self.rocket = Rocket(max_steps=self.max_steps, task=task)
        
        # Clear RL interface definition
        self.action_space = spaces.Discrete(len(self.rocket.action_table))
        self.observation_space = spaces.Box(low=-1.0, high=1.0, shape=(8,))
        
        # Easy to add preprocessing
        self.scaling_factors = {...}
```

This structure provides the best balance of maintainability, clarity, and flexibility while keeping the implementation simple and clean.
